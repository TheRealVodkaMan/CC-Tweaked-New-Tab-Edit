# CC-Tweaked-New-Tab-Edit
A small utility script for cc:tweaked to help the user edit multiple scripts in separate tabs.

This script includes an auto-complete feature, That was implemented using the "cc.shell.completion" built-in module, to easily navigate directories.

Make sure to run the "update_path.lua" file to properly use the script from any directory inside the shell.

# Installation

Drag and drop both "custom" and "update_path.lua" into the id folder of the computer you wish to install onto.

## Notes
You could copy the script from "update_path.lua" and write it into "startup.lua" which should be created in the root directory of the computer.
